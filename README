To get this to work you need to configure mysql and the python mysql bindings manually. But most of if not all of the python libaries needed can be accessed using the command:

source venv/bin/activate

which will initialize a virtual python environment. This project also assumes python2.7

To run the server just start it with
python manage.py runserver
