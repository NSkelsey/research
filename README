To get this to work you need to configure mysql and the python mysql bindings manually. But most of if not all of the python libaries needed can be accessed using the command:

source ./venv/bin/activate

that command will initialize a virtual python environment which has the nessecary libraries. This project also assumes python2.7

A dummy db of ~10,000 records in each table is included use mysql -uroot [dbname] < pans_db.txt to get into mysql
Its worth noting that alot of the python depends on an account for mysql which has uname:root and no password. I suppose we could change this.

To run the server just start it with:
python manage.py runserver

 django, mysql and sqlalchemy will all have to be working for that to work

if you can't get it working just ask me
